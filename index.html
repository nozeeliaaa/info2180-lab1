        <h2>Nozeelia Blair</h2>
        <p>Heyyy, I'm Nozeelia, a 21-year-old with a love for fashion, travel, and all things new! I adore shopping and playing dress-up games, and I’m always excited to explore new restaurants and destinations. I’m currently studying computer science, though I sometimes struggle with a little imposter syndrome. Despite the challenges, I’m determined to keep going and see where this journey leads!I'm interested in web development because it allows me to express my creativity while building interactive websites. The ability to blend creativity with computer science is something I find really exciting, and I think I'll truly enjoy exploring how to make unique and user-friendly applications. </p>
