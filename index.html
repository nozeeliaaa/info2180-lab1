        <h2>Nozeelia Blair</h2>
        <p>Heyyy, I'm Nozeelia, a 21-year-old with a love for fashion, travel and all things pink! I adore shopping and playing dress-up games like Everskies and Dress to impress, and I’m always excited to explore new restaurants and destinations,I'm obsessed with Hershey's Kisses, especially the rainbow brownie ones—they're seriously to die for! And don't even get me started on Tru Fru, it's such a vibe. My favourite artistes at the moment are Tokischa, Mr.Kitty, Pastel Ghost,Childish Gambino and Raw Cashh  I’m currently studying computer science, though I sometimes struggle with a little imposter syndrome. Despite the challenges, I’m determined to keep going and see where this journey leads me! I'm interested in web development because it allows me to express my creativity while building interactive websites. The ability to blend creativity with computer science is something I find really exciting, and I think I'll truly enjoy exploring how to make unique and user-friendly applications. </p>
